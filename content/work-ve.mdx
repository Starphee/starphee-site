### Experience

Over the the better half of the 2 years I've been running my youtube channel I've been able to work with multiple versions of Vegas Pro, Blender, DaVinci Resolve, and more.
I am able to do quick-cut subtitles, montages, transitions, rotoscoping, etc. Many hours working with computers has made me competant and reliable with resolving errors, and I would not need to request anything exta out of my client.

### Skills
I can use multiple softwares to complete your request, and make sure it meets your standards. I am able to Motion-Track, rotoscope, write subtitles, make trasnitions, recreate cinematic versions of scenes, and much more small details which perfect a video.
