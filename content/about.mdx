# Who is Starphee?

#### Hi! My name is Starphee, I'm a freelance media editor, Video-game connoisseur, YouTuber, and more! I make Minecraft Content on my YouTube channel, and enjoy directing my own micro movie sets. Over the course of my life I have developed many skills, have decided to finally share them with the world! I am usualy pretty active on most if not all of my social networks, so if you need anything feel free to shoot me a DM!
