### Pay Rates

First request is **FREE**! 

Afterwards, Custom memes are **FREE**, Color correction is $1, and other specific requests are $1.

### Experience

Although I have more time working with video, and the motion picture scene I still have a moderate amount of skill in photo editing. I am able to do pretty much whatever you ask of me for dirt cheep.

### Skills

I can cut things out, position photos, color correct photos, make memes, deepfry images, add glitch effects, and make custom logos.
