# _SPP INSTALL HELP_

1. Open the forge installer folder, and double click the .jar file.
[(make sure you have the newest version of java installed)](https://www.java.com/en/)

2. If forge says "You must run this version before install" or something like that, just run Minecraft 1.16.4 vanilla, and then close it and repeat step 1.

3. Go to the minecraft launcher and run the instalation named "forge 1.16.4"

4. In the main menu of the game click "mods", then "open mods folder". Now drag all the .jar files from the "Jar Mod Files" folder into the "mods" folder.

5. Restart Minecraft.

#### Done!

_Note: This modpack does not work with multiplayer yet, and only works with the forge version given._

# _PROVIDED SHADER INSTALL HELP_

1. In the options menu (with mods installed) in Minecraft, click "video settings", then click "shaders", then "open shaders folder"

2. From here move all 3 folders inside of the "Shaders" folder from the Starphee's Perfect pack folder, to the "shaderpacks" folder inside of the .minecraft folder.

#### Done! Just select the shaders of your choice inside of the "shaders" menu. (BSL works best.)
